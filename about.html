        <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
        <p>
          The website you are currently on was made entirely by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          It’s a little choppy in some areas, but I’ll get that fixed eventually. This website 
          serves as both an example of my artistic and coding skills and a testament to my 
          perseverance. I faced a lot of challenges while creating it, but I kept trying until 
          everything worked.

        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>
         I’ve always been deeply interested in computers, coding, and gaming for as long as I can remember. I love learning 
         how technology works behind the scenes and exploring how code can be used to create something new and useful. Whether
          it’s trying out new programming languages, building small projects, or just diving into a game to appreciate its design,
           I’m always curious about the connection between creativity and technology.

        <h2>involvement</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve always enjoyed being involved in my community and helping out where I can. One of the ways I’ve done that is by working 
          the polls during elections, where I got to see firsthand how voting works and help make the process run smoothly for everyone.
           I also helped host 8th grade CTC tours, guiding students around and showing them what opportunities were available. Both experiences
            taught me how to communicate clearly, stay organized, and take on responsibility, all skills that I’m proud to carry with me.
